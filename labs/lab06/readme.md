# Lab 6 - JavaScript and jQuery

## In this lab, we are going to work with jQuery and continue work on our personal websites
Problem 4b (10 pts) - what happens when you click on the new li?  Why? (Explain in your readme file)
   //   ie if it works as after #3 above, why? if it doesn't, why not?  How would you fix it?
4b. 
When you click on the new li the item turns red and back to black if you click once again. I used the on() method which attaches a parent element to the selected elements or child elements before the function() method in the on() method. For example, in this lab I used
$(document).on("click", "#labList li", function(){
In this case the parent element is the document itself and the child elements are click, which is when the element id "lablist" with tag "li" is clicked, go through with the function. This allows the list to turn red when you click a new item list. If you were to only do the click() function instead of the on() function, then it would only take the elements that exist at the time, but since we're appending new elements the function wouldn't work because its added after the fact.
